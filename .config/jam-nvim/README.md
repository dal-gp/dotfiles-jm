# jam nvim

Josh Medeski's minimalistic and smart Neovim config.

## Key Principles

- Only show what's absolutely necessary
- Use "smart" plugins that recude mental gymastics (if you're thinking about it, you've lost)
- Use pnemoics for key mappings and leverage muscle-memory

## How to try

- Create custom app in `.config/jam-nvim`
- Create `init.lua` with basic scaffolding (see how lazyvim does this)
- Run `NVIM_APPNAME=jam-nvim nvim`!
